I messed around with some ResNets to try and see how well they could count (without being explicitly taught to). I was hoping to get some insight into what sort of counting mechanisms CNNs might develop in order to succeed at a binary quantitative disrimination task (i.e. deciding whether there are more circles or squares in a given image). Our main result is that these mechanisms are not very robust, and tend to display large implicit biases. We also look a bit at how differently trained models fare on out-of-distribution images. You can find my rather informal writeup [here](https://github.com/c-mulliken/shapecounter/blob/main/writeup.pdf).
